##modelLogs
Contains text files with logs on how each model performed with different parameters. 

##Model Source Codes
TO RUN: Simply run the file in terminal <br>
Source code for the linear models is in linreg.py, lasso.py, and ridge.py. <br>
Source code for polynomial regression is in polyreg.py. <br>
Source code for multilayer perceptron is in mlp.py. However, most of the testing was done in mlpscratch.ipynb, 
as the final version of mlp.py was not run as it would be too time consuming. <br>
Source code for the random forest model is in randomForest.py. <br>
Source code for the boosted tree method is in lightGBM.py 

##Figures
